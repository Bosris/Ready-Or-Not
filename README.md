# Ready-Or-Not
A simple game

I just started my 18 week program at Hack Reactor (7/23/19) and thought Id use this as a way to improve my skills as a coder and challenge myself.

Id like to use this as a way to see my growth and progression through the program and as a way to apply what I learn to something outside of school.
As I learn new things I will update and improve this very basic game as I go.

7/24/19 - Second day of the program and I was able to get the game to work as intended by the use of browser prompts.
- Goals moving forward. Learn more HTML and CSS to make the browser more pleasant and interactive.
- Make the browser have a list of NPC's and hiding spots at updates as the game progresses
- Make improvements to the JS Code as I improve as a programmer.
