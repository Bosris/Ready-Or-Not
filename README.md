# Ready-Or-Not
A simple game

This is a place to practice my HTML and JS code.

The goals for this game:

There are a fixed number of players.
Each player picks a hiding spot.
One each player has their spot, the murder then randomly picks a spot and kills the person hiding in that spot.
Your goal is to be the last one alive.
